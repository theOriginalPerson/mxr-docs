## 4 Things to Remember!

#### GET

To retrieve something from the database (i.e. let's say you want to display someone's username on their profile, you'd use GET to retrieve that data)

#### POST

To post something to the database (i.e. creating a new account which requires a username and password to be stored, or POSTed to the database)

#### PUT

To put something in place of something else in the database (think of a person who wants to change their email address after being logged in - they're altering that data)

#### DELETE

Essentially removing something from the database (i.e. someone wants to delete their account)
