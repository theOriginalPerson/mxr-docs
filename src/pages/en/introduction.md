**Welcome to the Mohawk XR Dev Team Documentation!**

Here you will learn about all of the things required to get started on either of the senior or junior tasks. This documentation page will cover everything ranging from the following:

- ✅ **Getting to know our stack**
- ✅ **Using Git/Github**
- ✅ **Creating components for projects**
- ✅ **Understanding tasks**

## Getting Started

The first thing we have to do is introduce you to our base stack.

- **🚀 Astro**
- **👨‍🚀 Strapi**

Sweet and simple for now. But we might change this later to adapt to a more content-heavy website.

We also want you to understand that there will be two types of developers: 
- The **seniors** working on our main website or big picture projects
- The **juniors** who will be working on improving their skills in the projects assigned to them by the senior devs 

*Note* - yes, juniors will also be given a chance to assist with the website and big picture projects once they get comfortable with the overall stack.
