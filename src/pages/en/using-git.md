## Installation

#### Git

1) Go here --> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

3) Now that git is installed, we'll install Github!

#### Github Desktop

1) Go here --> https://desktop.github.com/
2) Make sure it's for the correct OS
3) Once complete, open the Github Desktop application and sign in
4) Connect your Github Desktop to your VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)
