## Project Ideas

Here are some possible projects you can build with Astro to a) build up your resume portfolio and b) boost your XP in our stack! Try to see how many you can
complete this year.

### Using Just Astro

- A set of documentation pages explaining your favourite software tools
- Portfolio website (this can also work with Strapi if you're up for the challenge)
- A business template landing page with About, Contact, Home pages
    - You can do this for a local business if you're really ambitious

### Using Astro + Strapi

- A to-do web application that stores reminders and simple lists of items that need to be completed
- E-commerce storefront with real orders (maybe try dropshipping, or sell something of your own)
- Social media app that stores messages (don't think Facebook - think Whatsapp. Something relatively simple that works effectively). If you're really ambitious, then think Facebook.
- A Spotify clone that plays classical music (this is the best kind of music that has no copyright attached to it)

**Note* - you'll most likely have to integrate other technologies in some of the more advanced project ideas, such as React, Vue, or any other library or framework to make your life easier.
Hardcoding this stuff in plain HTML and CSS can be a bit tedious.
