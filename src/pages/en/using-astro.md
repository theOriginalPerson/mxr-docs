## Installation

Use the following steps:
1) Open VSCode
2) <code>ctrl + `</code> (look at the top left corner of your keyboard, just under the <code>Esc</code> button)
3) Make sure you're in the main directory (folder) you want to be in
4) `npm create astro@latest` This will be our frontend, so we'll just call it `frontend` to keep it simple
5) Make sure you install node package modules too! If you're unsure if you have them or not, simply look to the sidebar where all your folders + files are in VSCode, 
and check to make sure they're in the main directory (folder). To install node package modules, run the following command: `npm install astro`
6) Nice! You made it
